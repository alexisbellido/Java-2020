Java Examples
=========================

Source files are in the `src` directory. Compiled classed in `out`.

If using packages you can run a compiled class like this.

.. code::

    $ cd out/production/Helloworld
    $ java com.example.helloworld.HelloWorld

You can compile outside of IDEA from the terminal and run in the `src` directory.

.. code::

    $ javac Simple.java
    $ java Simple

or you can compile and run with just one command.

.. code::

    $ java Simple.java
